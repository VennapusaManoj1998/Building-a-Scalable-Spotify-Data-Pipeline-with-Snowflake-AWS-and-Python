SPOTIFY Data Pipeline Using SNOWFLAKE, AWS and PYTHON

Imagine a symphony of data flowing seamlessly from the world of Spotify into the cloud, orchestrated by the magic of Python and the power of AWS and Snowflake. In this project, I designed and implemented an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that harmoniously blends the artistry of music with the precision of data processing.

First, Python gracefully dances with the Spotify API, extracting raw music data with finesse. This rich melody of data is then stored in an S3 bucket, carefully curated by a Lambda function. But the journey doesn't end there. Another Lambda function steps in, like a skilled conductor, expertly transforming the data to ensure it's harmonized and ready for its next performance.

But the grand finale is yet to come. With our transformed data in hand, the spotlight shifts to Snowflake. Here, Snowpipe takes the stage, triggered by events in the S3 bucket, orchestrating the seamless transfer of data into Snowflake, where it awaits its encoreâ€”analysis and insight.

And that's where the real magic happens. With our refined Snowflake data, we can create insightful dashboards that reveal the hidden gems within the music data, unlocking a world of valuable insights.

So, if you're ready to join this symphony of data, come and explore the repository to witness the harmonious fusion of music and technology!


Snowflake:

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform designed to handle large-scale data analytics.
It offers a fully managed service that requires no infrastructure management, providing elasticity and scalability on-demand.
Snowflake uses a unique architecture that separates storage, compute, and services, allowing for independent scaling of each component.
It supports various data types, including structured and semi-structured data, and provides native support for JSON, Avro, Parquet, and other formats.
Snowflake is known for its performance, enabling fast query processing and data manipulation through its optimized architecture.

AWS (Amazon Web Services):

AWS is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offered by Amazon, providing a wide range of services including computing power, storage, and databases.
It offers a global infrastructure with data centers located in different regions around the world, allowing users to deploy applications closer to their end-users for lower latency.
AWS provides a wide range of services for data storage, management, and analytics, including Amazon S3 for object storage, Amazon RDS for relational databases, and Amazon Redshift for data warehousing.
It offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing users to pay only for the resources they use without any upfront costs.
AWS is known for its reliability, security, and scalability, making it a popular choice for businesses of all sizes looking to leverage cloud computing services.

ETL

Extract:

In the extraction phase, data is collected from various sources such as databases, applications, flat files, or external systems.
The data is typically extracted in its raw form without any modifications, preserving its original structure and format.
Extraction methods can vary based on the source system and may involve querying databases, reading files, or using APIs to fetch data.

Transform:

The transformation phase involves cleaning, restructuring, and enriching the extracted data to make it suitable for analysis and storage.
Data transformation tasks can include filtering out irrelevant or duplicate records, converting data types, standardizing formats, and applying business rules.
Transformations are applied to ensure data quality, consistency, and compatibility with the target data model or analytics requirements.

Load:

In the loading phase, the transformed data is loaded into a target data repository such as a data warehouse, data mart, or database for storage and analysis.
Loading can be done in different ways, including batch processing, real-time streaming, or incremental updates depending on the data volume and latency requirements.
The loaded data is typically organized in a structured format optimized for querying and reporting, ready to be used for business intelligence, analytics, or other applications.
