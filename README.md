# SPOTIFY Data Pipeline Using SNOWFLAKE, AWS and PYTHON

In this project, I embarked on a journey to create a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that seamlessly integrates Spotify data with Snowflake and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The goal was to orchestrate a smooth flow of data from its source to a data warehouse for analysis, leveraging the power of Python, AWS Lambda, and Snowflake.

The first step was to harness the Spotify API using Python, enabling the extraction of diverse music data ranging from songs and albums to artist details. Python acted as the bridge between Spotify's vast music database and our pipeline, efficiently retrieving the required data.

Next, I leveraged AWS Lambda to store the extracted data in an S3 bucket, a scalable and secure storage solution provided by AWS. This step ensured that the raw data was safely stored and ready for further processing, laying the groundwork for the transformation phase.
The transformation stage was crucial in shaping the raw data into a structured and standardized format suitable for analysis. Another AWS Lambda function played a pivotal role here, meticulously applying transformation logic to harmonize the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

With the transformed data poised for its next chapter, Snowpipe, a feature of Snowflake, took center stage. Snowpipe seamlessly orchestrated the transfer of transformed data from the S3 bucket to Snowflake, a powerful data warehouse known for its scalability and performance.

In Snowflake, the transformed data awaited analysis, offering a treasure trove of insights into music trends, artist popularity, and user preferences. This final stage marked the culmination of the pipeline, showcasing the seamless integration of Spotify data with Snowflake and AWS, unlocking a world of possibilities for data-driven decision-making and analysis.

## Integrating Spotify Data with Snowflake and AWS

**Register for Spotify Developer Account: Sign up for a Spotify developer account on their website to gain access to their API.**

**Install Required Packages:** In your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter notebook or Google Colab), install the spotipy package using !pip install spotipy. This package allows you to interact with the Spotify API.

**Set Up Spotify API Credentials:** Obtain your client ID and client secret from the Spotify Developer Dashboard. Use these credentials to authenticate your API requests.

**Retrieve Playlist Data:** Use the spotipy library to fetch data from a Spotify playlist. This data typically includes information about albums, artists, and songs.

**Data Transformation:** Convert the raw data into a structured format, such as a Pandas dataframe, for easier analysis. Perform any necessary data cleaning or preprocessing steps.

**AWS Setup:** Log in to your AWS account. Set up an S3 bucket to store your data. Organize the bucket with folders for raw and transformed data.

**Lambda Functions:** Create AWS Lambda functions to automate the data extraction and transformation process. These functions can be triggered by events such as new data being added to the S3 bucket.

**Role and Permissions:** Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for your Lambda functions to access the S3 bucket and other AWS services.

**Data Loading to Snowflake:** If you're using Snowflake as your data warehouse, configure the integration between Snowflake and S3. Define stages and file formats in Snowflake to facilitate data loading.

**Snowpipe Setup:** Create Snowpipes in Snowflake to automatically load data from S3 into your Snowflake tables. Configure event notifications in S3 to trigger Snowpipes when new data is added.

**Testing and Monitoring:** Test your pipeline to ensure that data is being extracted, transformed, and loaded correctly. Set up monitoring and logging to track the performance of your pipeline.

**Dashboard Creation:** Once your data is loaded into Snowflake, you can use it to create insightful dashboards and visualizations for analysis.
